-- For example/fs.py, if we disable caches and run 32 bit platforms by running 32bit linux-smp kernel on ARM processors (timingCPU) (--arm-iset=arm) then I see the CPU requesting 8B words from memory via dcache-port
   which is wierd and so if I run simulation with --cacheline_size=4 it crashes....so for now have to make --cacheline_size=8 even if simulating 32 bit based platforms
   
   (it seems that these memory transactions are being issued by DTB,ITB.......maybe they are allowed to make bigger size transactions than that supported by system word_width)
