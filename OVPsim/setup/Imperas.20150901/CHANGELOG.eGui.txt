Install OVPsim_FreeRTOS_arm demo and see this file for a brief introduction
on running the Imperas eGui (based on Eclipse) IDE:
    $IMPERAS_HOME/Demo/Platforms/OVPsim_FreeRTOS_arm

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
------------------

Debug View:
- When a breakpoint is hit the instance corresponding to where the breakpoint 
  occurred is not always automatically selected. You can examine the status  
  info listed for each ID to find the one that indicates "breakpoint". (The 
  status is shown in parentheses at the end of the "ID" line)

Breakpoints View:
- In multiprocessor platforms, deleting or disabling breakpoints from the 
  breakpoint view or the source window view may not work. It is possible to 
  delete breakpoints from the MPD Console by using the gdb command
  'info breakpoints' to see the current breakpoints and 'delete <number>'
  to delete a specific breakpoint.

Memory View:
- If a memory monitor spans a region with both valid memory and invalid memory 
  the entire view will show as invalid memory.

Source View:
- Breakpoint markers in source file views may have spurious error markers 
  indicating "Breakpoint installation failed". This is due to the CDT 
  behavior of adding breakpoints on all targets, and can be ignored.

Programmers View:
- The Programmers View window does not update automatically when a breakpoint
  is hit. Selecting a different stack entry in the Debug view will cause it
  to update.
- The rbrk and wbrk fields are not functional. In the future these will allow
  eventpoints to be set to cause breaks on reads or writes of a register.

Programmers View events:
- Programmers View events may be managed by entering commands directly in the
  MPD console but are not displayed properly in the breakpoints view, and may
  cause spurious error messages.

A problem with "Clear Breakpoints Status" may be reported when terminating a 
simulation in some situations. This can be safely ignored.

The suspend button does not work when running the Windows 32-bit version on a
64-bit host (i.e. when setup.bat has been run with the -m32 option).
