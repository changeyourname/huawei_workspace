<h1>Running a simulation with Multiple cores</h1>
</a>
<p>
		This demo will show how to construct a platform containing two <a href=http://www.ovpworld.org/processor-model-variant-mips-classic-34kc title='look at OVPWorld page on this variant'>MIPS 34Kc</a>
		processor instances, and a memory map that provides both shared and local memory.
		All memory is shared except for a region of local memory used for the processor 
		stack and heap, this cannot be shared.
	</p>
<p><img src=../../../../pictures/Multicore2_Run.jpg alt=IMG_MULTI2_RUN height=400></p>
<p>
		The application:
	</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=../../../Applications/multicore2/multicore2_main.c title='look at application source'>multicore2_main.c</a> (<a href=../../../Applications/multicore2 title='look at application directory'>../../../Applications/multicore2/multicore2.CS_MIPS32LE-O1-g.elf</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
		can be executed on this platform. This pre-compiled application exchanges data 
		between the two processors. One processor generates a fibonacci sequence into a
		region of shared memory and the second reads the result and performs a simple 
		algorithm on it.
		<br/><br/>
		The application is loaded into the shared region and is executed by both 
		processors. The Id of each processor instance is used in the application to 
		select either generation of data or receiver for the data.
		<br/><br/>
		After the application has executed, a simulation summary will be printed,
		indicating the number of instructions executed, and the performance of the
		simulation in terms of Millions of simulated Instructions executed Per
		Second (MIPS).
		<br/><br/>
		A platform similar to the one used in this simulation, can be found in the example at <a href=../../../../../../Examples/Platforms/multiprocessor/platform title='look at platform example source/makefile'>../Examples/Platforms/multiprocessor/platform directory</a>. The example can be
		compiled using using <a href=http://www.ovpworld.org/resources/windows title='look at MinGW/MSYS download page on OVPWorld'>MinGW/MSYS</a> under Windows, and GCC under Linux.

<h1>Running the simulation</h1>
</a>
<h2>From a Microsoft window manager or Linux / MSYS shell</h2>
<p>
		Launch the platform with a pre-compiled application; in Windows by double 
		clicking one of the batch files (.bat) or in Linux / MSYS by executing one of the shell 
		scripts (.sh).
		<br/><br/>
		The scripts will be available dependent upon the applications available:
	</p>
<ul>
<li>Run_MultiCore2.bat (Windows)</br>Run_MultiCore2.sh (Linux/MSYS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The simulation will run and print statistics upon completion.</p>
<h2>From the command line</h2>
<p>
		If running a DOS command window, or a MSYS shell, or a Linux shell, simply change
		directory to an appropriate directory, then type the name of the ISS executable, iss.exe or issdemo.exe (dependent on installation), 
		provide the name of the variant you want after the --variant argument, and provide the
		application after the --program argument, for example:
		<br/><br/>
		cmd > issdemo.exe --variant 34Kc --numprocessors 2   --program ../../../Applications/multicore2/multicore2.CS_MIPS32LE-O1-g.elf
		<br/><br/>
		Note that often other options like --processorname and parameters such as --parameter endian=little, are also needed. Look at the above script files to see what is needed for a specific variant.
		<br/><br/>
		You can use issdemo.exe --help to see more options.
		<br/><br/>
		The simulation will run and print statistics upon completion.
	</p>

<h1>Interpreting results</h1>
</a>
<p>
		At the end of simulation, a number of statistics will be printed.
		Amongst the statistical information which is reported, are the number
		of 'Simulated instructions' and the 'Simulated MIPS'.
	</p>
<p><img src=../../../../pictures/Single_Run_Output.jpg alt=IMG_RUNOUTPUT height=200></p>
<p>
		The 'Simulated instructions' will vary depending upon the application being
		executed, this count indicates the number of simulated processor
		instructions for the processors in the platform.
		<br/><br>
		The 'Simulated MIPS' will be a measure of the number of 'Simulated
		instructions' over the host elapsed time.
		The simulation must run for around 1 second of simulated time in order to print 
		simulated MIPS statistics.
		<br/><br>
		If you have multiple processors in your simulation, there will be a statistics sections for
		each processor, and then a summary for the overall simulation run.
	</p>

<a id='rmWriteSectionBuild'>
<h1>Re-Building Platforms and Applications</h1>
</a>
<p>
		In order to rebuild a full product install must have been carried out. This may
		be the OVP 'OVPsim' package or one of the Imperas Professional Tools
		packages (*SDK or *DEV). 
		<br/><br>
		A processor cross compiler toolchain package must be installed to allow the 
		applications to be rebuilt.
	</p>
<p>
			An external toolchain to support this processor variant must be used. A set of Makefiles  
		    so support this processor variant may be available from OVPWorld, with a package name 
		    extension similar to <b>NAME..toolsupport.YYYYMMDD.v.OS.exe</b> Please check the requirements.		
			<br/><br>
		</p>
<p>
		A Makefile is supplied in the <a href=../../../../../../Examples/Platforms/simple/platform title='look at platform example source/makefile'>../Examples/Platforms/simple/platform directory</a> 
		that will perform the rebuilding of the platform 
		executable and also see the <a href=../../../Applications/multicore2 title='look at the applications directory'>applications directory</a> 
		for re-building the application ELF files.
	</p>
<h3>Re-building Platform</h3>
<p>
		The platform can be compiled using MSYS/MinGW 
		under Windows, and GCC under Linux.
		<br/><br>
		The compilation can be performed using the following command lines:
		<br/><br>
		<b>Windows Command shell</b><br>
		This requires an MSYS environment setup<br>
		>mingw32-make -f \%IMPERAS_HOME\%/ImperasLib/buildutils/Makefile.platform ^<br>
				  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SRC=platform.c ^<br>
				  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOVLNV=1<br>
		<br>
		<b>Linux or Windows MSYS shell (if you have an MSYS environment set up)</b><br>
		>make -f ${IMPERAS_HOME}/ImperasLib/buildutils/Makefile.platform \<br>
				 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SRC=platform.c \<br>
				 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOVLNV=1<br>
	</p>
<h3>Re-building Application</h3>
<p>
		The applications were built using a Cross Compiler toolchain, that may be 
		available from the OVPWorld website, which includes an CS_MIPS32LE.makefile.include
		that is used to setup a basic build environment for that toolchain. This can 
		be modified to use alternative compiler flags.
